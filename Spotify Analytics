# I acquired Spotify data from Kaggle for this project. 
# I then made a table into which I would insert Spotify data. 
# Finally, I used SQL to run statistics on the dataset.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# The Spotify Data.csv was then added to the table. 

# I then used the following SQL to further explore the data.

#Who was the top 10 artist based on popularity?
SELECT distinct artist_name,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10

#Which is the longest danceability track and who is the artist?
SELECT distinct artist_name,
danceability,
track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc

#For artist and track, what is the average for speechiness, energy, and instrumentalness?
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
avg(energy),
avg(speechiness),
avg(instrumentalness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#What are the top 3 songs that have the most accousticiness 
SELECT track_name,
acousticness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY acousticness desc

#What the loudest track name?
SELECT artist_name,
loudness,
track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness desc LIMIT 1
